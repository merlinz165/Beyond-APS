### How to Design a Database (IMPORTANT)

1. Requirements Analysis

- user needs; what must database do?

2. Conceptual Design

- high level description (often done w/ER model)

- Rails encourages you to work here

3. Logical Design

- translate ER into DBMS data model

- Rails requires you to work here too

4. Schema Refinement

- consistency, normalization

5. Physical Design

- indexes, disk layout

6. Security Design

- who accesses what, and how
